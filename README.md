# Pac-Man Game

This is a basic implementation of the Pac-Man game using Python and Pygame.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. You can install Pygame using the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
````

## How to Play

1. Run the `pacman_game.py` file using Python:

    ```bash
    python pacman_game.py
    ```

2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control Pac-Man's movement.

3. Collect pellets to increase your score. Each pellet is worth 10 points.

4. Avoid the ghosts! If Pac-Man collides with a ghost, the game is over.
